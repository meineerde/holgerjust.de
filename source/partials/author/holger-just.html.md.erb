I'm a software developer and operations engineer from Berlin,
Germany. I want to bridge the gap between those functions by building and
maintaining a [DevOps culture](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-devops-yet-again)
throughout my work.

I am a contributor to [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org) and was project
lead of [ChiliProject](https://www.chiliproject.org). I am a contributer
to [Chef](https://www.chef.io) and have created and maintain several [Chef
cookbooks](https://github.com/meineerde-cookbooks/) and a few general-pupose
[Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/meineerde).

I strongly believe in the values of Open Source and strive to be an
integral part of the community by not only providing source code but also
advice, help, and organisational support to advance the status quo.

If you want to contact me, preferrably send an email to <%= author_email %>
in either German or English. I am
[<%= blog_author.profile_links[:github][:user] %>](<%= blog_author.profile_links[:github][:link] %>) on GitHub and
[@<%= blog_author.profile_links[:twitter][:user] %>](<%= blog_author.profile_links[:twitter][:link] %>) on Twitter.
I try to help people on [Stack Overflow](<%= blog_author.profile_links[:stackoverflow][:link] %>).
