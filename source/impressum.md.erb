Personal contact is my preferred way of communication. If you see me, do not hesitate to talk to me. If you can't talk to me in person, please use e-mail. If you take a second to compose a good subject line, your mail will not be confused with spam. You can reach me at:

<p><address style="text-align: center">
  <span class="icon-mail"><span class="hidden">E-Mail:</span></span>
  <%= author_email %>
</address></p>

If you want to send me physical mail, you can use this postal address:

<p><address>
  Holger Just<br>
  Frankfurter Allee 53<br>
  10247 Berlin<br>
  GERMANY
</address></p>
